Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here:
http://math2.org/math/geometry/circles.htm

Create a function called calcCircumfrence:
- Pass the radius to the function.
- Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".

Create a function called calcArea:
- Pass the radius to the function.
- Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

// write your solution here...
function calcCircumference(radius){
    radius = prompt("What is the radius?");
    var circumference = ;
}calcCircumference();
